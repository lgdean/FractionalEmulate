This concept is analogous to fractional stable:
do the given call until you've turned the stated fraction,
and then continue with the rest of the call, but emulate.

As with the fractional stable concept, different people may start
working emulate at different times.

Thanks to Janet Chuang for accidentally discovering the concept,
to Rachel Chasin for naming it, and to me for writing about it.

This concept came about when the author expressed frustration that Zip
the Top had no apparent relation to the other ``the top'' calls -- in
particular, nobody was casting off 3/4. 
``Well, actually, it's Fan the Top, but emulate after turning 1/4,''
Janet helpfully noted.  And I suppose it is!

Some fun equivalences:

\begin{tabular}{ll}
\hline
1/4 emulate Fan the Top   & Zip the Top \\
1/4 emulate Cast off 3/4 (from mini-wave)  & Shazam \\
1/4 emulate Trade (from mini-wave)   & Single Wheel \\
1/4 emulate Scoot Back  & Single Ferris Wheel \\
1/4 emulate Couples Trade  & Stack the Wheel \\
\hline \\
\end{tabular}

Some other notes I wrote to myself (and now wonder why):

\begin{tabular}{ll}
\hline
?? 1/4 emulate Box Transfer  & (ends in 2-faced line, other handedness?) \\
1/4 emulate Follow Your Neighbor  & (same as previous?) \\
?? 1/2 emulate Box Transfer  & (Follow Thru and Stack the Wheel?) \\
\hline \\
\end{tabular}


Many calls that feel good end up being ``and roll'' or ``and roll and
roll'' endings of existing calls.  This is probably just because we
haven't explored the space enough yet.

Some calls won't work well, because the movement isn't well-defined
when you've turned a certain number of quarters.  Consider, for
example, zoom: the leader's position is well-defined after 1/2, but
not after 1/4 or 3/4.  Likewise, 1/4 emulate split transfer could be a
fun call, but do the leaders have well-defined spots?
