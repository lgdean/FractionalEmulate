This concept is analogous to fractional stable:
do the given call until you've turned the stated fraction,
and then continue with the rest of the call, but emulate.

As with the fractional stable concept, different people may start
working emulate at different times.

Thanks to Janet Chuang for accidentally discovering the concept,
to Rachel Chasin for naming it, and to me for writing about it.

This concept came about when the author expressed frustration that Zip
the Top had no apparent relation to the other ``the top'' calls -- in
particular, nobody was casting off 3/4. 
``Well, actually, it's Fan the Top, but emulate after turning 1/4,''
Janet helpfully noted.  And I suppose it is!

Some fun equivalences:

\begin{tabular}{ll}
\hline
1/4 emulate Fan the Top   & Zip the Top \\
1/4 emulate Cast off 3/4 (from mini-wave)  & Shazam \\
1/4 emulate Trade                          & Single Wheel \\
1/4 emulate Scoot Back  & Single Ferris Wheel \\
1/4 emulate Couples Trade  & Stack the Wheel \\
\hline \\
\end{tabular}

Some more complicated (and no less fun) equivalences:

\begin{tabular}{ll}
\hline
1/4 emulate Box Transfer          & Follow Thru; U-Turn Back \\
 & (or: Tandem Twosome Shazam) \\
1/4 emulate Follow Your Neighbor  & same as previous :) \\
1/2 emulate Box Transfer          & something ending in a Z (TODO: diagram) \\
 & (does this breathing work correctly?) \\
Leads work 1/4 emulate, Follow Your Leader & Follow Your Neighbor \\
Fractal, 1/4 emulate Follow Your Leader    & Follow Your Neighbor \\
\hline \\
\end{tabular}



Many calls that feel good end up being ``and roll'' or ``and roll and
roll'' endings of existing calls.  This is probably just because we
haven't explored the space enough yet.

Some calls won't work well, because the movement isn't well-defined
when you've turned a certain number of quarters.  Consider, for
example, zoom: the leader's position is well-defined after 1/2, but
not after 1/4 or 3/4.

\subsection*{An interesting non-analogy}

The fractional emulate concept is analogous to fractional stable,
but (at least) one property is different.
With fractional stable,
if a given call X is legal from a given starting setup,
then fractional stable X is also possible.
(This is also true for just-plain stable, or emulate.)
With fractional emulate, this is not the case!
Consider, for example: 1/2 emulate, Box Circulate twice.
In this call, people try to end up in the same spot,
with the same facing direction
(so they can't even think about taking right hands).
